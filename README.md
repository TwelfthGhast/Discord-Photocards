# Discord-Photocards
Virtual Photocard collection in discord servers (guilds)

Initially wrote this for a friend who wanted a custom bot in discord to simulate the collection of photocards (commonly done in korean pop fan communities).

This is currently not designed to scale across guilds/servers, and does require a separate bot per guild/server.

Please install the following dependencies.
```
# python3 -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate
# pip3 install pillow
# pip3 install discord
```

# To-Do List
* Save the state of the running program using either pickle or a database.
* Create commands to create new collections using the discord interface
